## Task 1

### Handling exceptions in MSTests

1. In the implementation project create your own implementation of the fibonacci sequence. Just in case below you can find a implementation that you can use. Please try to use your own, though.

2. In the unit tests project write tests to cover all cases except this one when ```index < 0```.

3. Write a unit test which uses ``` try catch ``` to cover a case when exception is thrown.

4. Write a unit tests which uses ``` ExpectedException ``` attribute to cover the same case as in the point 3.
